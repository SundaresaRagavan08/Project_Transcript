Here is a summary of the conversation you provided:

Project Overview:
•	The team is developing a web-based dashboard for a telecom company, potentially called Fabertech or Fibatic.
•	Purpose: Help the telecom company manage customer plans, data usage, and offer real-time network status features.

Core Features Discussed:
1.	User Dashboard
o	View plan details, usage stats, data consumption.
o	Options to add, edit, delete, or top-up plans.
o	Payment integration via credit card, UPI, etc.
o	Real-time network signal strength tracking (4G, 5G, etc.).
o	Notifications for plan renewals and offers.
2.	Admin Dashboard
o	View all users and active plans.
o	Add, edit, and delete plans.
o	Manage user access and handle customer details.
o	Possibly multilingual support.

Technology Stack:
•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
•	Backend: Python (for server-side logic)
•	Database: Initially one, possibly two (one for user info, one for customer login)
•	Security:
o	Two-step verification (security questions like favorite color, animal).
o	Login system may be required to avoid unauthorized access.


Development Plan:
•	Start with the webpage creation.
•	Interface will be used by telecom companies, not individual users.
•	Consider using GitHub for version control and Visual Studio Code for development.

Key Decisions Made:
•	Two dashboards: One for users, one for admins.
•	Login system: Likely to be implemented for better security.
•	Payments: Secure processing through JavaScript with transaction logging.

Final Remarks:
•	Discussion ended with the agreement to summarize this chat (done here).
•	Transcript is to be saved and shared for reference.
